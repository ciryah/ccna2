!All physical cabling is in place and verified. Connectivity between all four switches must be established and operational.
!All ports are pre-configured as 802.1q trunks.
!1. Configure both SW1 and SW2 ports e0/1 and e0/2 to permit only the allowed VLANs(VLAN 56 and 77)
ena
conf t
int ra e0/1-2
switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan 56,77
end
!2. Configure both SW3 and SW4 ports e0/2 to permit only the allowed VLANs
ena
conf t
int e0/2
switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan 56,77
!3. Configure both SW1 and SW2 e0/1 ports to send and receive untagged traffic over VLAN 99
ena
conf t
int e0/1
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk native vlan 99
end

!4. Configure both SW3 and SW4 ports e0/0 and e0/1 for link aggregation using the industry standard protocol. All ports must immediately negotiate the link aggregation.
